## üöÄ Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

**TLDR:** Fork the repo, authorize Vercel to manage your fork and watch it deploy the site to a live domain for you.

## üî® Installation

1. Download and extract [the latest release](https://github.com/Kyriokes/Bastardos/releases) and navigate to the newly created folder
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` (make sure displaying file extensions is enabled) and fill in your configuration. The **only** required variables are:
    - `CFTOOLS_API_APPLICATION_ID`: Application ID from your [CFTools Developer Apps](https://developer.cftools.cloud/applications) - Authorization has to be granted by navigating to the `Grant URL` that's displayed in your app overview
    - `CFTOOLS_API_SECRET`: Same as above, click `Reveal Secret`
    - `CFTOOLS_SERVER_API_ID`: Click `Manage Server` in your [CF Cloud Panel](https://app.cftools.cloud/dashboard) > `Settings` > `API Key` > `Server ID`
3. Rename `config.example.json` to `config.json` and customize the project for the Bastardos Server
4. Run the following commands in this exact order:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the project
npm run start
```

The project is now available on [port 3002](http://localhost:3002/). This is only available on your local network.

To allow anyone to reach your website basic knowledge of web-servers (like [Apache](https://apache.org/) or [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)) is required.

- An example Nginx file is included for your convenience.
- With this conf Nginx serves all static assets, if these fail to load (like no styles applied to the website) use the minimal conf instead

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The configuration has been pre-customized for the DayZ Bastardos Server but can be further modified in the `config.json` file.

### .env

```bash
# CFTools API Credentials - The ONLY required values here
# CFTOOLS_SERVER_API_ID will only be used AS THE DEFAULT
# when using multiple server setup in the config file
CFTOOLS_API_APPLICATION_ID=
CFTOOLS_API_SECRET=
CFTOOLS_SERVER_API_ID=

# Runtime Environment - production/development/staging
NODE_ENV=production

# Development-only - Analyze the app bundle
ANALYZE=true

# If provided, uses these values for the og:image meta tag (discord embed link previews)
# If omitted, uses your branding logo from the config file as a small image
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_LARGE_OG_IMAGE=false
```

### Bastardos Server Customization

This version includes specific customizations for the DayZ Bastardos Server:
- Custom branding and theming
- Server-specific configuration
- Optimized player statistics display
- Community-focused features

## Common Issues

### ERR_ABORTED
If you're getting `net::ERR_ABORTED 404` errors, that means you have created a new production build (`npm run build`) but the process listening on your port is still trying to serve previous build files - fix this by restarting your process.
